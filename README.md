# Library Management System | Software Development Project

Technologies: Python, Desktop GUI, Excel Backend, Modular Architecture

Architected a desktop-based library management system in Python to automate book check-in and check-out operations.

Integrated an Excel-based backend as a lightweight database, reducing manual administrative tracking time by approximately 40%.

Designed a modular and extensible system architecture to support future migration to an SQL-based database and web deployment.

Focused on usability, maintainability, and real-world operational efficiency.

👉 This shows that you are not “just hardware” — you solve operational problems with software.
